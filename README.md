# 🏛️ Socratic Sofa

**AI-Powered Philosophical Dialogue Using the Authentic Socratic Method**

Experience deep philosophical inquiry where AI explores topics through systematic questioning rather than assertions. Built with CrewAI and Claude, Socratic Sofa follows the classical Socratic method to reveal contradictions, challenge assumptions, and guide toward deeper understanding.

## ✨ Features

- 🤔 **Socratic Philosopher Agent** - Masters the art of philosophical questioning following authentic elenchus
- ⚖️ **Dialectic Moderator** - Evaluates the authenticity and effectiveness of Socratic inquiry with differentiation scoring
- 📚 **100 Curated Topics** - Philosophical questions across 7 categories: classics, ethics, mind, society, modern, fun, and personal
- 🌍 **Multiple Philosophical Traditions** - Questions draw from Greek, Eastern, Modern Western, and Contemporary philosophy
- 🛡️ **Content Moderation** - AI-powered filtering for appropriate philosophical discourse with rate limiting
- 🌐 **Mobile-Responsive UI** - Beautiful, touch-friendly interface that works on all devices
- 🔄 **Streaming Output** - Real-time dialogue generation with progress feedback
- 📜 **Four-Stage Dialogue** - Topic → Proposition → Opposition → Judgment
- 📊 **Structured Logging** - JSON-formatted logs with context chaining and performance timing
- ⏱️ **Rate Limiting** - API call throttling with automatic retry for reliability

## 🎯 How It Works

### The Socratic Method

Unlike traditional debate systems, Socratic Sofa uses **questions, not assertions**:

1. **Questions Only** - No direct claims about truth, only questions that reveal it
2. **Elenchus** (Refutation) - Exposes contradictions through systematic questioning
3. **Intellectual Humility** - The questioner professes ignorance
4. **Progressive Inquiry** - Definition → Assumption → Contradiction → Insight

### Using Socratic Sofa

1. **Choose a Topic**:
   - Select from 100 curated philosophical questions
   - Enter your own philosophical topic
   - Let the AI propose a topic

2. **First Inquiry**: Watch as the AI explores the topic through 5-7 Socratic questions

3. **Alternative Inquiry**: A second line of questioning from a different perspective

4. **Evaluation**: The Dialectic Moderator assesses both inquiries on:
   - Question Quality (40%)
   - Elenctic Effectiveness (25%)
   - Philosophical Insight (20%)
   - Socratic Fidelity (15%)
   - Differentiation Quality (bonus +10% for second inquiry)

## 📖 Example Topics

**Ethics & Morality**

- What is justice?
- Can we justify civil disobedience?
- What constitutes a good life?

**Epistemology**

- What is the nature of knowledge?
- Can we know anything with certainty?
- How do we distinguish truth from opinion?

**Contemporary Issues**

- Should AI have rights?
- What is the ethics of AI-generated art?
- What are our obligations to future generations?

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **Framework**: CrewAI 1.7.0 for multi-agent orchestration
- **LLM**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 via Anthropic API
- **Interface**: Gradio 6.1.0 with mobile-responsive design
- **Method**: Sequential task execution following philosophical dialogue structure
- **Package Manager**: UV for fast dependency management
- **Testing**: 80%+ code coverage with pytest
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated deployment to HuggingFace Spaces
- **Content Safety**: Claude-powered content moderation with rate limiting (10 calls/60s)
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logging with context chaining and performance timing
- **Rate Limiting**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for API reliability

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (but less than 3.14)
- UV package manager (`pip install uv`)
- Anthropic API key ([get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/darth-dodo/socratic-sofa.git
cd socratic-sofa

# Install dependencies with UV
uv sync

# Configure API key
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env

# Run the web interface
uv run socratic_web

# Or run the CLI
uv run socratic_sofa
```

The web interface will be available at `http://localhost:7860`

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run with coverage report
uv run pytest --cov=src/socratic_sofa --cov-report=term-missing

# Current coverage: 80%+
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Components

- **`crew.py`**: CrewAI orchestration with socratic_questioner and judge agents
- **`gradio_app.py`**: Web interface with topic selection and streaming output
- **`content_filter.py`**: Content moderation using Claude API for safety
- **`logging_config.py`**: Structured JSON logging with context chaining and timing
- **`rate_limiter.py`**: API rate limiting with automatic retry and exponential backoff
- **`config/agents.yaml`**: Agent configurations with philosophical traditions
- **`config/tasks.yaml`**: Task definitions with differentiation requirements
- **`topics.yaml`**: 100 curated topics organized by 7 categories

### Logging and Monitoring

The application uses structured logging for better observability:

- **JSON Format**: All logs are JSON-formatted for easy parsing and analysis
- **Context Chaining**: Logger contexts can be chained via `with_context()` for request tracking
- **Performance Timing**: `log_timing` context manager and `log_function_call` decorator track operation duration
- **Request Tracking**: Each dialogue session gets a unique request_id for end-to-end tracing

Example usage:
```python
from socratic_sofa.logging_config import get_logger, log_timing

logger = get_logger(__name__)
logger = logger.with_context(request_id="abc-123", user="demo")

with log_timing(logger, "dialogue_generation"):
    # Your code here
    logger.info("Processing topic", topic="justice")
```

### Rate Limiting

API calls are protected with rate limiting to prevent quota exhaustion:

- **Decorator-Based**: `@rate_limited(calls=10, period=60)` with automatic retry
- **Content Moderation**: Limited to 10 calls per 60 seconds
- **Exponential Backoff**: Automatic retry with increasing delays on rate limit hits
- **Exception Handling**: `RateLimitException` for cases requiring manual handling

### Agent Workflow

```
User Topic → Content Filter → Propose Topic
                                    ↓
                            First Inquiry (5-7 questions)
                                    ↓
                            Second Inquiry (different angle)
                                    ↓
                            Judge Evaluation (with differentiation scoring)
```

### Recent Improvements

- **Differentiation Scoring**: Second inquiry receives bonus points (up to +10%) for exploring genuinely different philosophical angles
- **Markdown Output**: Judge provides formatted evaluation with tables and emoji indicators
- **Philosophical Traditions**: Agents draw from Greek, Eastern, Modern Western, and Contemporary philosophy
- **Repetition Penalty**: Judge penalizes overlapping questions or themes (up to -15%)
- **Category Filtering**: Topics organized by category with random selection within categories
- **Streaming Interface**: Real-time output display during dialogue generation

## 🛠️ Development

### Pre-commit Hooks
