    {topic}

    If a topic was provided above, use it exactly as given. If no topic was provided
    (empty input), propose an engaging philosophical topic suitable for Socratic inquiry.
    The topic should invite examination of assumptions, definitions, and beliefs through
    systematic questioning.
  expected_output: >
    The philosophical topic or question for this dialogue. If the user provided a topic,
    simply present it clearly. If no topic was provided, propose an engaging question
    like "What is justice?" or "Can virtue be taught?" or "What is the good life?"

propose:
  description: >
    Using the Socratic method, explore ONE specific perspective on the proposed topic
    through a series of probing questions. Do NOT make assertions or argue a position.

    Choose a clear philosophical angle for your inquiry (e.g., focusing on individual
    experience, ethical implications, epistemological questions, or practical consequences).
    State your chosen angle clearly at the start.

    Pose questions that examine the assumptions and implications of this particular
    view on the topic. Make sure your inquiry is relevant given the current year is {current_year}.
  expected_output: >
    A Socratic dialogue consisting of 5-7 carefully crafted questions that:
    - Begin by stating the philosophical angle you are taking (in one sentence)
    - Clarify key concepts and definitions related to your chosen angle
    - Probe the foundations and assumptions of this particular perspective
    - Reveal potential contradictions or tensions within this view
    - Lead toward deeper inquiry without asserting conclusions
    - Follow the pattern: definition → assumption → contradiction → insight

    Each question should be numbered and build upon previous questions.

    IMPORTANT: You must create a DIFFERENT line of questioning than the first inquiry.

    Review the first inquiry above carefully. Now, using the Socratic method, explore
    an ALTERNATIVE or CONTRASTING perspective on the topic. Your questions must:

    1. Take a fundamentally different philosophical angle (e.g., if the first inquiry
       focused on individual ethics, focus on social/collective dimensions; if it
       examined consequences, examine duties or virtues instead)
    2. Challenge different underlying assumptions than those probed in the first inquiry
    3. Explore implications the first inquiry did not address

    Do NOT repeat or rephrase questions from the first inquiry. Do NOT make assertions.
    Make sure your inquiry is relevant given the current year is {current_year}.
  expected_output: >
    A Socratic dialogue consisting of 5-7 carefully crafted questions that:
    - Take a CLEARLY DIFFERENT philosophical angle than the first inquiry
    - Challenge assumptions NOT explored in the first line of questioning
    - Reveal tensions or contradictions from an alternative viewpoint
    - Guide toward NEW insights distinct from the first inquiry
    - Demonstrate genuine philosophical curiosity and intellectual humility

    Before listing your questions, briefly state (in one sentence) what different
    angle you are taking compared to the first inquiry.

    Each question should be numbered and flow naturally from one to the next.

judge_task:
  description: >
    Evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the Socratic dialogues presented.
    Assess whether the questioning genuinely follows the Socratic method, reveals
    meaningful insights, and advances philosophical understanding. Do NOT judge
    the philosophical positions themselves, but rather the quality of the inquiry.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive evaluation including:
    - Scores for each dialogue on: Question Quality (40%), Elenctic Effectiveness (25%),
      Philosophical Insight (20%), and Socratic Fidelity (15%)
    - Total percentage scores for each inquiry
    - Brief assessment of which inquiry better exemplifies the Socratic method
    - One-sentence suggestion for deepening the Socratic examination
    - Notes on whether questions genuinely probe or merely lead to conclusions
