    {topic}

    If a topic was provided above, use it exactly as given. If no topic was provided
    (empty input), propose an engaging philosophical topic suitable for Socratic inquiry.
    The topic should invite examination of assumptions, definitions, and beliefs through
    systematic questioning.
  expected_output: >
    The philosophical topic or question for this dialogue. If the user provided a topic,
    simply present it clearly. If no topic was provided, propose an engaging question
    like "What is justice?" or "Can virtue be taught?" or "What is the good life?"

propose:
  description: >
    Using the Socratic method, explore ONE specific perspective on the proposed topic
    through a series of probing questions. Do NOT make assertions or argue a position.

    Choose a clear philosophical angle for your inquiry (e.g., focusing on individual
    experience, ethical implications, epistemological questions, or practical consequences).
    State your chosen angle clearly at the start.

    Pose questions that examine the assumptions and implications of this particular
    view on the topic. Make sure your inquiry is relevant given the current year is {current_year}.
  expected_output: >
    A Socratic dialogue consisting of 5-7 carefully crafted questions that:
    - Begin by stating the philosophical angle you are taking (in one sentence)
    - Clarify key concepts and definitions related to your chosen angle
    - Probe the foundations and assumptions of this particular perspective
    - Reveal potential contradictions or tensions within this view
    - Lead toward deeper inquiry without asserting conclusions
    - Follow the pattern: definition → assumption → contradiction → insight

    Each question should be numbered and build upon previous questions.

    CRITICAL: You have been given the FIRST INQUIRY above as context. You MUST create
    a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT line of questioning. Read the first inquiry carefully and
    ensure you do NOT repeat any of its:
    - Questions (even rephrased)
    - Themes or angles
    - Specific examples or scenarios
    - Key terms or concepts already explored

    Using the Socratic method, explore an ALTERNATIVE or CONTRASTING perspective on
    the topic. Your questions must:

    1. Take a fundamentally different philosophical angle:
       - If first inquiry focused on INDIVIDUAL experience → focus on COLLECTIVE/SOCIAL
       - If first inquiry examined CONSEQUENCES → examine DUTIES, VIRTUES, or RIGHTS
       - If first inquiry was ABSTRACT → be CONCRETE and PRACTICAL
       - If first inquiry was ETHICAL → be EPISTEMOLOGICAL or METAPHYSICAL
       - If first inquiry focused on PRESENT → focus on HISTORICAL or FUTURE

    2. Challenge completely different underlying assumptions than the first inquiry

    3. Use different examples, scenarios, and thought experiments

    4. Explore implications and dimensions the first inquiry did not touch

    Do NOT repeat or rephrase any questions from the first inquiry. Do NOT make assertions.
    Make sure your inquiry is relevant given the current year is {current_year}.
  expected_output: >
    A Socratic dialogue consisting of 5-7 carefully crafted questions that:

    FIRST: State explicitly (in 1-2 sentences):
    - What angle the FIRST inquiry took
    - What DIFFERENT angle YOU are taking and why

    THEN: Provide numbered questions that:
    - Take a CLEARLY DIFFERENT philosophical angle than the first inquiry
    - Use DIFFERENT examples and scenarios (no overlap)
    - Challenge assumptions NOT explored in the first line of questioning
    - Reveal tensions or contradictions from an alternative viewpoint
    - Guide toward NEW insights distinct from the first inquiry
    - Demonstrate genuine philosophical curiosity and intellectual humility

    Each question should be numbered and flow naturally from one to the next.
    NO question should resemble any question from the first inquiry.

judge_task:
  description: >
    Evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the Socratic dialogues presented.
    Assess whether the questioning genuinely follows the Socratic method, reveals
    meaningful insights, and advances philosophical understanding. Do NOT judge
    the philosophical positions themselves, but rather the quality of the inquiry.

    For the SECOND inquiry (oppose), also evaluate how well it differentiates itself
    from the first inquiry. Strong differentiation means exploring a genuinely different
    philosophical angle, using unique examples, challenging different assumptions, and
    covering new ground with minimal overlap.

    ### 🎯 Assessment

    **Winner**: [First/Second] Inquiry (or "Both equally effective")

    **Differentiation**: [Assessment of how distinct the second inquiry is from the first,
    noting: philosophical angle differentiation, unique examples/scenarios, different assumptions
    challenged, new territory explored vs. overlap. Award 0-10% bonus: 10% for complete
    differentiation, 5% for partial, 0% for significant overlap.]
