# Custom Topics Guide

Learn how to create effective custom philosophical topics for Socratic Sofa that generate rich, insightful dialogues.

## Overview

While the topic library provides 100 curated questions, the real power of Socratic Sofa lies in exploring your own philosophical inquiries. This guide teaches you how to craft topics that work effectively with the Socratic method.

## Understanding Effective Topics

### What Makes a Good Socratic Topic?

**Core Principles:**

1. **Open-Ended**: No single correct answer
2. **Depth**: Multiple layers to explore
3. **Assumption-Rich**: Contains beliefs to examine
4. **Debatable**: Reasonable people can disagree
5. **Universal**: Relevant beyond specific contexts

**Example Analysis:**

✅ **Good: "What is justice?"**

- Open to interpretation
- Requires defining terms
- Challenges assumptions
- Connects to real-world issues
- Allows for counterexamples

❌ **Poor: "What year was Plato born?"**

- Factual question
- Single correct answer
- No assumptions to examine
- No philosophical depth
- Limited exploration

### The Socratic Method Requirements

Your topic should allow for:

**1. Definition Clarification**

- Can terms be defined precisely?
- Are definitions contested?
- Do definitions reveal assumptions?

**2. Assumption Identification**

- What beliefs underlie positions?
- Are assumptions justified?
- Can assumptions be separated?

**3. Contradiction Exploration**

- Do positions contain internal contradictions?
- Can counterexamples be found?
- Are there paradoxes to examine?

**4. Progressive Refinement**

- Can initial positions be improved?
- Do questions build on each other?
- Is deeper understanding possible?

## Topic Formulation Strategies

### Question Types That Work Well

#### "What is..." Questions

**Format:** "What is [concept]?"

**Examples:**

- What is justice?
- What is consciousness?
- What is beauty?
- What is knowledge?

**Why They Work:**

- Require conceptual analysis
- Challenge obvious definitions
- Reveal hidden assumptions
- Allow progressive refinement

**Crafting Your Own:**

```
Template: What is [fundamental concept]?

Good concepts:
- Abstract nouns (freedom, truth, love)
- Philosophical terms (virtue, wisdom, essence)
- Contested ideas (intelligence, creativity, success)

Avoid:
- Concrete objects (chair, car, phone)
- Technical terms with standard definitions
- Proper nouns (who is..., where is...)
```

#### "Should..." Questions

**Format:** "Should [action/policy]?"

**Examples:**

- Should we colonize Mars?
- Should AI have rights?
- Should there be limits on speech?
- Should we always tell the truth?

**Why They Work:**

- Involve moral reasoning
- Require balancing values
- Challenge intuitions
- Connect principle to practice

**Crafting Your Own:**

```
Template: Should [we/people/society] [action]?

Strong actions:
- Ethically complex (lie, restrict, enhance)
- Value-laden (prioritize, protect, sacrifice)
- Socially significant (regulate, permit, forbid)

Avoid:
- Purely personal preferences
- Obviously yes/no answers
- Factual predictions
```

#### "Can/Could..." Questions

**Format:** "Can [possibility]?"

**Examples:**

- Can machines think?
- Can we know anything for certain?
- Could time travel create paradoxes?
- Can virtue be taught?

**Why They Work:**

- Explore possibilities and limits
- Question assumptions about reality
- Allow thought experiments
- Mix metaphysics and epistemology

**Crafting Your Own:**

```
Template: Can/Could [possibility]?

Strong possibilities:
- Philosophical (know, understand, prove)
- Metaphysical (exist, occur, persist)
- Ethical (justify, obligate, permit)

Avoid:
- Technical abilities (build, compute, measure)
- Future predictions (will happen)
- Physical constraints (physics laws)
```

#### "Is..." Questions

**Format:** "Is [claim/state]?"

**Examples:**

- Is free will real or an illusion?
- Is morality relative or universal?
- Is consciousness physical?
- Is beauty objective or subjective?

**Why They Work:**

- Present clear alternatives
- Challenge binary thinking
- Reveal nuanced positions
- Force justification

**Crafting Your Own:**

```
Template: Is [claim] or [alternative]?

Strong contrasts:
- Philosophical dichotomies (real/illusory, objective/subjective)
- Metaphysical options (material/immaterial, natural/supernatural)
- Ethical frameworks (absolute/relative, universal/particular)

Avoid:
- Factual questions (is water H2O?)
- Obvious answers (is murder wrong?)
- False dichotomies (forced binary without middle ground)
```

### Contemporary Topics

#### Technology & Society

**Strong Examples:**

- Should social media companies moderate content?

- "Is online identity real identity?"
```

#### Environmental Ethics

**Strong Examples:**

- Do future generations have rights?
- Is nature intrinsically valuable?

- Is self-improvement a moral duty?

**Crafting Personal Topics:**

```
Template: [Life aspect] + [values/meaning question]

Formula: Should/Can/What is [life domain] [philosophical dimension]?

Examples:
- "Should we pursue passion or stability in careers?"
- "Can relationships be purely rational?"
- "Is authenticity more important than kindness?"
```

```

## Advanced Topic Design

### Paradoxes & Thought Experiments

**Effective Formats:**

**Paradox Format:**

```
"Can [seemingly contradictory possibility]?"

Examples:
- Can an omnipotent being create a stone it cannot lift?
- Can you change the past without creating a paradox?
- Can a set contain itself?
```

**Thought Experiment Format:**

```
"If [hypothetical scenario], [philosophical question]?"

Examples:
- If you could live forever, would life still have meaning?
- If you could read minds, would privacy matter?
- If perfect happiness required ignorance, would you choose it?
```

**Dilemma Format:**

```
"Is it better to [option A] or [option B]?"

Examples:
- Is it better to be a dissatisfied human or a satisfied pig?
- Is it better to be feared or loved?
- Is it better to have loved and lost or never loved at all?
```

### Combining Multiple Dimensions

**Technique: Intersectional Topics**

Combine two philosophical domains:

**Ethics + Metaphysics:**

- "Do moral obligations exist independently of minds?"
- "Is there a fact of the matter about right and wrong?"

**Epistemology + Political Philosophy:**

- "Should experts have more political power?"
- "Can democracy produce knowledge?"

**Aesthetics + Ethics:**

- "Is there a moral duty to create beautiful things?"
- "Can art be immoral?"

**Mind + Technology:**

- "Would an uploaded mind be conscious?"
- "Could a simulation have authentic experiences?"

### Cultural & Comparative Angles

**Cross-Cultural Questions:**

```
Format: "Is [concept] universal or culturally specific?"

Examples:
- Is the concept of self universal?
- Are moral values culturally relative?
- Is beauty standards universal?
```

**Historical Perspectives:**

```
Format: "Has [concept] changed fundamentally over time?"

Examples:
- Has human nature changed with technology?
- Is modern ethics different from ancient ethics?
- Has consciousness evolved?
```

## Topic Refinement Process

### Iterative Improvement

**Step 1: Initial Draft**
Write your question quickly without overthinking.

**Step 2: Clarity Pass**

- Remove ambiguity
- Define key terms
- Specify scope

**Step 3: Depth Check**

- Add layers if too simple
- Simplify if too complex
- Balance breadth and depth

**Step 4: Assumption Analysis**

- Identify presuppositions
- Ensure assumptions are examinable
- Check for hidden biases

**Step 5: Socratic Preview**

- Imagine possible questions
- Consider counterexamples
- Anticipate contradictions

**Step 6: Final Polish**

- Optimize wording
- Check grammar
- Ensure philosophical tone

### Example Refinement

**Version 1 (Initial):**
"Is technology bad?"

**Version 2 (Clarity):**
"Is technology harmful to society?"

**Version 3 (Depth):**
"Does technology fundamentally change what it means to be human?"

**Version 4 (Assumptions):**
"Should we accept technology's transformation of human nature?"

**Version 5 (Final):**
"Is the technological enhancement of human capacities desirable?"

**Analysis:**

- V1: Too vague, binary
- V2: Clearer but still binary
- V3: Deeper, more nuanced
- V4: Adds normative dimension
- V5: Precise, philosophical, assumption-rich
