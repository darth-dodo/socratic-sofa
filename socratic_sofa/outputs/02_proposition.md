1. What do we mean by the term "knowledge"? How would you define knowledge, and how does it differ from other cognitive states like belief, opinion, or understanding?

2. What do you consider to be the primary sources or foundations of knowledge? To what extent can knowledge be derived from our senses, reason, authority figures, or other means? What are the strengths and limitations of each source?

3. How can we determine whether a particular claim or belief constitutes genuine knowledge, as opposed to mere opinion or conjecture? What criteria or standards would need to be met for something to qualify as knowledge?

4. Are there different forms or types of knowledge, such as empirical, a priori, tacit, or procedural knowledge? If so, how do these various forms relate to and inform each other?

5. What role does doubt, uncertainty, and fallibility play in the acquisition and justification of knowledge? To what extent should we maintain intellectual humility about the limits of what can be known with certainty?

6. Do you believe there are any universal, objective truths that can be known, or is all knowledge ultimately shaped by the subjective perspectives and social/historical contexts of the knower? How might power dynamics influence our understanding of what counts as knowledge?

7. Given the complexities involved in defining, sourcing, and validating knowledge, how might we approach the philosophical question of the nature of knowledge with appropriate nuance and caution? What would an intellectually humble and rigorous inquiry into this topic entail?
