What is the nature of knowledge? This philosophical question opens the door for Socratic exploration of several key issues:

- What do we mean by "knowledge"? How do we define and differentiate knowledge, belief, opinion, and other cognitive states? 
- What are the sources and foundations of knowledge? Can knowledge come from senses, reason, authority, or other means? What are the strengths and limitations of each?
- How can we determine whether a particular claim constitutes knowledge? What criteria or standards must be met?
- Are there different types or forms of knowledge (e.g. empirical, a priori, tacit, procedural)? If so, how do they relate to each other?
- What is the role of doubt, uncertainty, and fallibility in the acquisition and justification of knowledge?
- Do individuals or cultures have privileged access to certain kinds of knowledge? How do power dynamics and social/historical contexts shape our understanding of knowledge?
- Are there universal, objective truths that can be known, or is all knowledge inherently subjective and relative?

This line of Socratic questioning can lead to deeper examination of epistemology, the theory of knowledge, and the underlying assumptions we bring to claims about what can be known. It invites the interlocutor to critically examine their own beliefs and reasoning about the nature, sources, and limits of human knowledge. The ultimate goal would be to foster greater intellectual humility and nuanced understanding, rather than arriving at any definitive conclusions.
