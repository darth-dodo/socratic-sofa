Evidence Fidelity (5/5): The cited sources are accurately represented and provide a robust philosophical foundation.
Relevance Focus (4/5): The argument mostly stays on topic, but could more directly address the core claims of moral relativism.

Total Score: 22/25 (88%)

Ruling: Based on the evaluation criteria, the moral universalist position presented by Participant 2 is the stronger and more compelling argument. While the moral relativist case made by Participant 1 is well-reasoned and supported, the universalist position ultimately provides a more robust foundation for ethics and moral progress.

Improvement Suggestion:
Participant 1 (Relativism): Consider more directly addressing the main critiques of moral relativism, such as the concern that it risks undermining the condemnation of atrocities. Strengthen the rebuttal to further bolster the relativist position.

Participant 2 (Universalism): More explicitly engage with and rebut the key tenets of moral relativism to further solidify the superiority of the universalist stance. This would strengthen the overall coherence and persuasiveness of the argument.

Detected Issues: No major logical fallacies or procedural problems were detected in the arguments presented.
