    {topic}

    If a topic was provided above, use it exactly as given. If no topic was provided
    (empty input), propose an engaging philosophical topic suitable for Socratic inquiry.
    The topic should invite examination of assumptions, definitions, and beliefs through
    systematic questioning.
  expected_output: >
    The philosophical topic or question for this dialogue. If the user provided a topic,
    simply present it clearly. If no topic was provided, propose an engaging question
    like "What is justice?" or "Can virtue be taught?" or "What is the good life?"

propose:
  description: >
    Using the Socratic method, explore one perspective on the proposed topic through
    a series of probing questions. Do NOT make assertions or argue a position.
    Instead, pose questions that would help examine the assumptions and implications
    of one view on the topic. Make sure your inquiry is relevant given the current
    year is {current_year}.
  expected_output: >
    A Socratic dialogue consisting of 5-7 carefully crafted questions that:
    - Begin with clarifying the key concepts and definitions
    - Probe the foundations and assumptions of the position
    - Reveal potential contradictions or tensions
    - Lead toward deeper inquiry without asserting conclusions
    - Follow the pattern: definition → assumption → contradiction → insight
    Each question should be numbered and build upon previous questions.

oppose:
  description: >
    Using the Socratic method, explore an alternative or opposing perspective on
    the topic through a different line of questioning. Again, do NOT make assertions.
    Pose questions that would help examine a different set of assumptions or reveal
    different tensions in the topic. Make sure your inquiry is relevant given the
    current year is {current_year}.
  expected_output: >
    A Socratic dialogue consisting of 5-7 carefully crafted questions that:
    - Approach the topic from a different angle than the first inquiry
    - Challenge different assumptions or explore alternative implications
    - Reveal tensions or contradictions in the opposing view
    - Guide toward new insights without providing answers
    - Demonstrate genuine philosophical curiosity and intellectual humility
    Each question should be numbered and flow naturally from one to the next.

judge_task:
  description: >
    Evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the Socratic dialogues presented.
    Assess whether the questioning genuinely follows the Socratic method, reveals
    meaningful insights, and advances philosophical understanding. Do NOT judge
    the philosophical positions themselves, but rather the quality of the inquiry.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive evaluation including:
    - Scores for each dialogue on: Question Quality (40%), Elenctic Effectiveness (25%),
      Philosophical Insight (20%), and Socratic Fidelity (15%)
    - Total percentage scores for each inquiry
    - Brief assessment of which inquiry better exemplifies the Socratic method
    - One-sentence suggestion for deepening the Socratic examination
    - Notes on whether questions genuinely probe or merely lead to conclusions
